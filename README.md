# ML-Based-Disease-Prediction-System

## Description:

The ML-Based Disease Prediction System aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict potential diseases based on user-input symptoms. By utilizing five key symptoms provided by users, the project employs three distinct algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Na√Øve Bayes, to analyze the data and deliver accurate predictions.
